Many genres of games \\nexist that can be \\nplayed during \\nthese \\ntournaments \\nincluding (1) \\nFirst Person Shooter Games such \\nas Halo 2, \\n(2) \\nMultiplayer Online Battle \\nArena (MOBA) games \\nsuch as Dota 2 and League of \\nLegends, \\n(3) \\nStrategy Games \\nsuch as Starcraft, \\n(4) \\nFighting \\nGames, \\n(5) \\nSports \\nGames, \\nand \\n(5) Racing Games. The newest genre \\nof eSports is \\nSurvivor Games \\nlike Fortnite Battle Royale and \\nPlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds (PUBG). \\n\\n\\nFigure 20. What an eSports Event Looks Like \\n\\n\\nHigh-speed Internet and cheaper, more \\npowerful computers have spurred the growth \\nof eSports \\n\\nSource: Shutterstock \\n\\neSports Evolution \\n\\n\\neSports has been around for some time, probably dating back to \\norganized \\ncompetitions in universities \\n \\nSpacewar, Atari Space \\nInvaders Championship, and \\nNintendo \\nWorld Championships. The availability of high-speed \\nInternet in homes \\nand Internet cafes along \\nwith \\ncheaper, \\nmore powerful personal computers have \\npaved the way for video gamers to \\nconnect with one another to compete, compare \\nscores, and \\nshare strategies. Free-to-play online spectator-friendly games then \\npaved the way for the formation of fan bases who congregate \\nto watch \\nand \\ncheer \\nfor their favorite players. In 2000, the first eSports association was founded \\nin \\nSouth \\nKorea to promote and regulate eSports in the country given the \\ntremendous \\npopularity of StarCraft. In \\n2002, as the player base expanded globally, Major \\nLeague Gaming was formed to promote video \\ngames \\nas \\na sport. \\n\\n\\n 2018 \\nCitigroup \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n4646\\nCiti GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions August 2018 \\n\\nThe average age of gamers has increased \\nwith 50% under the age of 35 vs. 75% back \\nin 2003 \\n\\nIn 2011, \\nTwitch, an \\nonline \\nstreaming service which allowed any players \\nto broadcast \\ntheir own gaming experience to the Internet at large, was launched. \\nTwitch offered \\nan avenue for engagement between the broadcaster and the \\naudience via a \\nchat \\nwindow \\nwhere fans \\ncould leave comments and connect with \\nthe players \\nand \\neach \\nother. \\nThe first League of Legends \\nand \\nthe International Dota 2 tournaments were \\nheld \\nin 2011. In 2014, \\nAmazon acquired \\nTwitch for $970 \\nmillion in \\na cash \\ndeal \\nto \\nhelp \\ndrive \\nits \\nexpansion \\ninto the digital distribution of gaming. \\nYouTube Gaming was \\nlaunched byAlphabet (Google) in \\n2015. \\n\\nThe age range \\nof gamers is another important factor to consider. According to \\nNVIDIA, in 2003 \\n75% \\nof gamers were under \\nthe \\nage or 35; \\ntoday 50% of gamers \\nare under 35. We are seeing \\na steady increase in \\nthe \\ntotal addressable market \\n(TAM) of overall \\ngamers \\nas younger generations \\nenter the fray and older \\ngenerations \\ncontinue to \\ngame. \\nWe believe that this \\ngamer for life \\nphenomenon will \\ntranslate well \\ninto \\ngrowing \\neSports participants and audiences \\ncompared \\nwith \\nmore \\nestablished sports leagues, \\nwhich \\nhave a strong \\nbase of older generation viewers. \\nAdditionally, unlike \\ntraditional \\nphysically demanding \\nsports, gamers \\ncan \\ncontinue to \\ngame as \\nthey age, creating \\nopportunity for larger tournaments. Given the infancy of \\neSports, however, professional gamers today tend \\nto be younger than their \\ntraditional sporting \\npeers. \\n\\n\\nFigure 21.

Newzoo estimates that the average revenue per eSports \\nenthusiast is ~$5.49, \\nwhich \\npales when \\ncompared with $15$50 per \\nfan in revenues \\nfor traditional sports \\nlike basketball andAmerican football. \\nThe global \\nnature of \\neSports games \\nalso \\nmakes it challenging to engage a local \\nregional fan base while \\nthe \\nebb and flows in popularity of certain games/genres at any given point could \\nshorten the duration span \\nfor making \\na return on investments, \\nthereby demotivating \\nsignificant sponsorship. \\n\\n\\nOne recent development has \\nbeen the \\ncreation of a franchised structure \\nsimilar to \\nthose of traditional \\nsports leagues \\nin the U.S. \\n(i.e., \\nthe \\nNational Football League \\n(NFL), National BasketballAssociation (NBA), and Major League Baseball (MLB)). \\nMajor game publishers Riot Games and Blizzard Entertainment have \\nnow started to \\noperate the NorthAmerican League \\nof Legends Championship and Overwatch \\nLeague in a franchised \\nstructure with regional teams. \\nThis \\nstructure is helping to \\ntransform \\ngames \\ninto all-round entertainment franchises, attracting \\nmore \\ngamers \\nwho may choose to adopt it as a career option. A franchised \\nstructure \\nalso offers \\ngreater certainty of the \\nteams \\nparticipating in the \\nleague \\neach year, attracting \\ninvestments from broadcasters and content buyers, sponsors, advertisers, \\nand their \\nagencies. The Overwatch League has \\nnow attracted investments \\nfrom the \\nlikes of \\nNew England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, LA Rams owner Stan \\nKroenke, \\nand \\nothers, each who have agreed to franchise fees of $20 million over the next few \\nyears. We believe \\nthis franchised structure will be replicated \\nacross \\nother eSports \\ngame leagues domestically in \\nNorthAmerica and could pave the way for uptake \\nin \\nother regions.Another example is \\nthat of the National BasketballAssociation, \\nwhich \\nis the first traditional \\nsports league to have \\ncreated an eSports partnership with \\nTake \\nTwo Interactive Software. \\n\\nAnother factor that we believe \\ncould spur the dollar growth of the \\neSports economy \\nis \\ngrowing interest from \\nboth \\nmedia and telecom \\ncompanies. With viewership \\nof \\ntraditional sports waning, we expect the battle \\nfor \\ncontent to increase \\nover \\ntime, \\nand \\nmedia companies will want to \\nbecome \\nmore involved in \\nowning \\nmedia rights \\nto \\ncontent. \\nTo this point, ESPN/ Disney and Blizzard Entertainment, the \\nmakers of the \\nvideo game Overwatch, have recently signed a \\nmulti-year deal \\nto \\nbroadcast the \\nOverwatch League \\nGrand Finals from \\nthe Barclays Center in New \\nYork. \\n\\n 2018 \\nCitigroup \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nAugust 2018 Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions Citi GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions \\n\\n49\\nTheyve also agreed to \\nbroadcast \\nSeason 2 \\nin 2019 \\non ESPN, ESPN2, Disney XD, \\nABC, \\nand \\nstreaming services for the \\nterm of the agreement. While ESPN has aired \\neSports events at other time \\nslots before, this agreement marks the first time that \\nlive competitive \\ngaming will be aired on ESPN in prime time \\nand will be the first \\nbroadcast of an eSports championship onABC. This is also the first time a network \\nhas \\napproved a \\nmulti-year agreement for eSports, airing an \\nentire season of the \\ngames, and \\nmany are comparing this to agreements ESPN enjoys with other major \\nsports leagues (i.e., the \\nNBA). We note \\nmedia rights (TV and digital) account for \\n50%+ of the \\nNFL's \\nestimated revenues with FOX, ESPN/ABC, CBS, NBC, Direct \\nTV etc., which \\npay an average of $7 \\nbillion per year to \\nair these games. TV media \\nrevenues have been \\na key driver for continuous NFL revenue growth from \\n$4 billion \\nin 2001 to ~$13 \\nbillion \\nin 2016. \\nWe expect \\nTV deals similar to \\nthose \\nannounced \\nby \\nESPN to continue to be \\na driving factor for the overall eSports ecosystem. \\n\\n\\nThese are \\njust some of the factors in play. As the eSports industry evolves we \\nexpect to see \\nsignificant development in the underlying infrastructure (player \\nsalaries, contracts, governance, college \\nsponsorships, media deals) that can help \\nimprove \\nthe \\neconomics for the entire ecosystem. \\n\\n\\nWinners/ Losers \\n\\n\\nDespite the disruption eSports could \\ncause to traditional sport viewership, there are \\ngroups that will benefit from its increasing \\npopularity: \\n\\n\\n \\nMedia companies \\nthat \\nhave deep pockets \\nand \\nthe \\noverall audience reach \\nto \\nensure they can \\nget media rights to broadcast the \\ncontent and maintain \\ntheir \\nranking within their viewership \\nbase. \\n \\nLarge Internet companies that \\nown specialized gaming channels with \\nsignificant \\nviewership and can demand \\nlarge sums for rights to broadcasting \\ncontent and \\nadvertising revenues. \\n \\nSpecialized hardware \\nmanufacturers such as gaming device OEMs, graphics \\nprocessing \\nunit (GPU) \\nmakers (86% \\nof gamers use NVIDIAGeForce GPUs), \\nhigh-end \\nswitch \\nmakers, and peripheral \\nmanufacturers \\n(i.e., \\nperformance \\nenhanced keyboards, mice, headsets, speakers, gamepad controllers \\nlike \\nLogitech G gaming peripherals), as \\nthese \\nhave \\nbecome necessary equipment for \\nprofessional gamers as gaming content is becoming increasingly \\ndemanding. \\nThese brands are \\nnow sponsoring eSports teams. \\n \\nLarge \\ngame developers/publishers \\nthat \\ncan continue to leverage their current \\nsuccess \\nacross \\nmultiple genres to \\nattract teams and fans to their games. \\nOn the other hand \\nthe \\nfollowing industries could \\nsee potential disruptions: \\n\\n\\n \\nTraditional sport leagues and franchises as viewership and participation \\nare \\ndiverted \\naway towards gaming. One point to note is that even though \\nthe \\nSuper \\nBowl remains the largest TV attraction by far, viewership has \\nbeen \\ndeclining, \\nwith \\n2018 viewership of ~103 million, down from its peak \\nof 114 \\nmillion viewers in \\n2015, according \\nto Nielsen Media. \\n \\nSporting brands (e.g. athletic \\nwear, athletic \\nfootwear, sporting goods \\nstores) \\ntypically associated with traditional \\nsports \\nnetworks. \\n \\nMedia networks that are not traditionally associated with broadcasting eSports \\nrisk losing viewership and advertising revenues. \\n 2018 \\nCitigroup \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n5050\\nCiti GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions August 2018 \\n\\nMichael Rollins, CFA \\n\\nU.S. Telecom & Communications \\nInfrastructure Analyst \\nAdam Ilkowitz, CFA \\n\\nU.S. Telecommunications Research Team \\nWe are on the verge of another leap forward \\nin wireless technology \""

       "\"6. eSports The Rise of the Professional Gamers eSports (also known as electronic sports or professional video gaming) is a form of competition using video games. Most commonly, eSports take the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions between professional players. Similar to traditional sporting events like the FIFAWorld Cup, sports fans get together to watch their favorite professional teams compete while several millions also tune in to watch a live stream or highlights of the event. These video game tournaments can be played across many devices including PCs, consoles, and tablets, though PCs are predominantly used in tournaments given their computing power and speed. Many genres of games exist that can be played during these tournaments including (1) First Person Shooter Games such as Halo 2, (2) Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games such as Dota 2 and League of Legends, (3) Strategy Games such as Starcraft, (4) Fighting Games, (5) Sports Games, and (5) Racing Games. The newest genre of eSports is Survivor Games like Fortnite Battle Royale and PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds (PUBG). eSports Evolution eSports has been around for some time, probably dating back to organized competitions in universities Spacewar, Atari Space Invaders Championship, and Nintendo World Championships. The availability of high-speed Internet in homes and Internet cafes along with cheaper, more powerful personal computers have paved the way for video gamers to connect with one another to compete, compare scores, and share strategies. Free-to-play online spectator-friendly games then paved the way for the formation of fan bases who congregate to watch and cheer for their favorite players. In 2000, the first eSports association was founded in South Korea to promote and regulate eSports in the country given the tremendous popularity of StarCraft. In 2002, as the player base expanded globally, Major League Gaming was formed to promote video games as a sport. 2018 group \\x0c 4646 GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions August 2018 The average age of gamers has increased with 50% under the age of 35 vs. 75% back in 2003 In 2011, Twitch, an online streaming service which allowed any players to broadcast their own gaming experience to the Internet at large, was launched. Twitch offered an avenue for engagement between the broadcaster and the audience via a chat window where fans could leave comments and connect with the players and each other. The first League of Legends and the International Dota 2 tournaments were held in 2011. In 2014, Amazon acquired Twitch for $970 million in a cash deal to help drive its expansion into the digital distribution of gaming. YouTube Gaming was launched byAlphabet (Google) in 2015. The age range of gamers is another important factor to consider. According to NVIDIA, in 2003 75% of gamers were under the age or 35; today 50% of gamers are under 35. We are seeing a steady increase in the total addressable market (TAM) of overall gamers as younger generations enter the fray and older generations continue to game. We believe that this gamer for life phenomenon will translate well into growing eSports participants and audiences compared with more established sports leagues, which have a strong base of older generation viewers. Additionally, unlike traditional physically demanding sports, gamers can continue to game as they age, creating opportunity for larger tournaments. Given the infancy of eSports, however, professional gamers today tend to be younger than their traditional sporting peers. Where Fast forward a couple more years, and these are the latest stats on eSports. Newzoo, a leading industry expert consultancy firm on eSports and gaming, claims the eSports global audience base comprises 143 million enthusiasts who watch eSports more than once a month and another 192 million estimated to be occasional viewers in 2017. As a comparison, the 143 million eSports enthusiasts fan base is on par with the ~150 million who claim to be fans of American football (based on a study in 2015). 2018 group \\x0c August 2018 GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions 47 Newzoo predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14%15% in this audience base. In 2017, there were 588 major eSports events that generated an estimated $59 million in ticket revenues, up from 424 events and $32 million in ticket revenues in 2016. The total prize money of all eSports events held in 2017 reached $112 million, breaking the $100 million mark for the first time. The 2017 International eSports tournament offered a prize pool of $24.7 million larger than the prize pool of the 2017 Confederations Cup (FIFA) and twice the size of the 2017 Masters (golf) Tournament and all but $1.6 million of that $24.7 million was crowdfunded. Twitch TV now boasts more than 1 million monthly daytime viewers on average, bringing its viewership on par with MSNBC and higher than CNN, which averaged 725,000 monthly daytime viewers duringApril 2018. More than 173,000 spectators attended the Intel Extreme Masters event in Poland. League of Legends World Championship 2017 Grand Finals were held in the Beijing National Stadium (previously the 2008 Olympics Stadium Bird's Nest) with over 57 million total unique viewers logging in to see the finals. eSports is being considered as a demonstration sport by the Olympic Committee. The NationalAssociation of College eSports currently has 81 member colleges and universities, with 79 of them providing partial or full athletic scholarships to student gamers. Despite strong viewership vs. traditional sports, profitability and monetization have been challenging for eSports Monetization and Profitability Remain Key Challenges Despite the impressive growth stats listed above, profitability and monetization have been challenging for the eSports ecosystem. Newzoo estimates that in 2017 the eSports economy totaled $470 million, and it is predicted to grow to ~$1 billion in 2018.As impressive as that sounds, it pales when compared with traditional sports such as the NFL, which raked in $1.3 billion in sponsorship revenue in 2017 alone, with total revenues grossing over $13 billion. 2018 group \\x0c 4848 GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions August 2018 The creation of franchised structures could help the development of eSports Growing interest from media and telecom companies should also spur growth of the eSports economy One of the key challenges has been that eSports is still very much in its infancy compared with traditional sporting leagues that were founded almost 100 years ago. Therefore, we believe the industry is still refining the structure that will pave the way for improved monetization. Newzoo estimates that the average revenue per eSports enthusiast is ~$5.49, which pales when compared with $15$50 per fan in revenues for traditional sports like basketball andAmerican football. The global nature of eSports games also makes it challenging to engage a local regional fan base while the ebb and flows in popularity of certain games/genres at any given point could shorten the duration span for making a return on investments, thereby demotivating significant sponsorship. One recent development has been the creation of a franchised structure similar to those of traditional sports leagues in the U.S. (i.e., the National Football League (NFL), National BasketballAssociation (NBA), and Major League Baseball (MLB)). Major game publishers Riot Games and Blizzard Entertainment have now started to operate the NorthAmerican League of Legends Championship and Overwatch League in a franchised structure with regional teams. This structure is helping to transform games into all-round entertainment franchises, attracting more gamers who may choose to adopt it as a career option. A franchised structure also offers greater certainty of the teams participating in the league each year, attracting investments from broadcasters and content buyers, sponsors, advertisers, and their agencies. The Overwatch League has now attracted investments from the likes of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, LA Rams owner Stan Kroenke, and others, each who have agreed to franchise fees of $20 million over the next few years. We believe this franchised structure will be replicated across other eSports game leagues domestically in NorthAmerica and could pave the way for uptake in other regions.Another example is that of the National BasketballAssociation, which is the first traditional sports league to have created an eSports partnership with Take Two Interactive Software. Another factor that we believe could spur the dollar growth of the eSports economy is growing interest from both media and telecom companies. With viewership of traditional sports waning, we expect the battle for content to increase over time, and media companies will want to become more involved in owning media rights to content. To this point, ESPN/ Disney and Blizzard Entertainment, the makers of the video game Overwatch, have recently signed a multi-year deal to broadcast the Overwatch League Grand Finals from the Barclays Center in New York. 2018 group \\x0c August 2018 GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions 49 Theyve also agreed to broadcast Season 2 in 2019 on ESPN, ESPN2, Disney XD, ABC, and streaming services for the term of the agreement. While ESPN has aired eSports events at other time slots before, this agreement marks the first time that live competitive gaming will be aired on ESPN in prime time and will be the first broadcast of an eSports championship onABC. This is also the first time a network has approved a multi-year agreement for eSports, airing an entire season of the games, and many are comparing this to agreements ESPN enjoys with other major sports leagues (i.e., the NBA). We note media rights (TV and digital) account for 50%+ of the NFL's estimated revenues with FOX, ESPN/ABC, CBS, NBC, Direct TV etc., which pay an average of $7 billion per year to air these games. TV media revenues have been a key driver for continuous NFL revenue growth from $4 billion in 2001 to ~$13 billion in 2016. We expect TV deals similar to those announced by ESPN to continue to be a driving factor for the overall eSports ecosystem. These are just some of the factors in play. As the eSports industry evolves we expect to see significant development in the underlying infrastructure (player salaries, contracts, governance, college sponsorships, media deals) that can help improve the economics for the entire ecosystem. Winners/ Losers Despite the disruption eSports could cause to traditional sport viewership, there are groups that will benefit from its increasing popularity: Media companies that have deep pockets and the overall audience reach to ensure they can get media rights to broadcast the content and maintain their ranking within their viewership base. Large Internet companies that own specialized gaming channels with significant viewership and can demand large sums for rights to broadcasting content and advertising revenues. Specialized hardware manufacturers such as gaming device OEMs, graphics processing unit (GPU) makers (86% of gamers use NVIDIAGeForce GPUs), high-end switch makers, and peripheral manufacturers (i.e., performance enhanced keyboards, mice, headsets, speakers, gamepad controllers like Logitech G gaming peripherals), as these have become necessary equipment for professional gamers as gaming content is becoming increasingly demanding. These brands are now sponsoring eSports teams. Large game developers/publishers that can continue to leverage their current success across multiple genres to attract teams and fans to their games. On the other hand the following industries could see potential disruptions: Traditional sport leagues and franchises as viewership and participation are diverted away towards gaming. One point to note is that even though the Super Bowl remains the largest TV attraction by far, viewership has been declining, with 2018 viewership of ~103 million, down from its peak of 114 million viewers in 2015, according to Nielsen Media. Sporting brands (e.g. athletic wear, athletic footwear, sporting goods stores) typically associated with traditional sports networks. Media networks that are not traditionally associated with broadcasting eSports risk losing viewership and advertising revenues. 2018 group \\x0c 5050 GPS: Global Perspectives & Solutions August 2018 Michael Rollins, CFA U.S. Telecom & Communications Infrastructure Analyst Adam Ilkowitz, CFA U.S. Telecommunications Research Team We are on the verge of another leap forward in wireless technology\""

This is also the first time a network has approved a multi-year agreement for eSports, airing an entire season of the games, and many are comparing this to agreements ESPN enjoys with other major sports leagues (i.e., the NBA). We note media rights (TV and digital) account for 50%+ of the NFL's estimated revenues with FOX, ESPN/ABC, CBS, NBC, Direct TV etc., which pay an average of $7 billion per year to air these games. TV media revenues have been a key driver for continuous NFL revenue growth from $4 billion in 2001 to ~$13 billion in 2016. We expect TV deals similar to those announced by ESPN to continue to be a driving factor for the overall eSports ecosystem. These are just some of the factors in play. As the eSports industry evolves we expect to see significant development in the underlying infrastructure (player salaries, contracts, governance, college sponsorships, media deals) that can help improve the economics for the entire ecosystem. Winners/ Losers Despite the disruption eSports could cause to traditional sport viewership, there are groups that will benefit from its increasing popularity: Media companies that have deep pockets and the overall audience reach to ensure they can get media rights to broadcast the content and maintain their ranking within their viewership base. Large Internet companies that own specialized gaming channels with significant viewership and can demand large sums for rights to broadcasting content and advertising revenues. Specialized hardware manufacturers such as gaming device OEMs, graphics processing unit (GPU) makers (86% of gamers use NVIDIAGeForce GPUs), high-end switch makers, and peripheral manufacturers (i.e., performance enhanced keyboards, mice, headsets, speakers, gamepad controllers like Logitech G gaming peripherals), as these have become necessary equipment for professional gamers as gaming content is becoming increasingly demanding. These brands are now sponsoring eSports teams. Large game developers/publishers that can continue to leverage their current success across multiple genres to attract teams and fans to their games. On the other hand the following industries could see potential disruptions: Traditional sport leagues and franchises as viewership and participation are diverted away towards gaming. One point to note is that even though the Super Bowl remains the largest TV attraction by far, viewership has been declining, with 2018 viewership of ~103 million, down from its peak of 114 million viewers in 2015, according to Nielsen Media. Sporting brands (e.g. athletic wear, athletic footwear, sporting goods stores) typically associated with traditional sports networks. Media networks that are not traditionally associated with broadcasting eSports risk losing viewership and advertising revenues. \\x0c 5050 Michael Rollins, CFA U.S. Telecom & Communications Infrastructure Analyst Adam Ilkowitz, CFA U.S. Telecommunications Research Team We are on the verge of another leap forward in wireless technology\""
