2. Anti-Aging 
Medicines 
Advancing Health by 
Turning Back Time 


The legend of the restorative 
powers of the Fountain of 
Youth has 
fascinated human 
civilization 
throughout the generations, dating 
all 
the way 
back to the Greeks (e.g., 
Herodotus). Other hypothetical conduits for 
a return to a 
state of youthfulness (e.g. 
the 
Philosopher’s Stone) have 
featured prominently throughout human 
civilization 
as alluring, but equally elusive. Fast forward to 2018, 
and very recent cutting-edge 
scientific breakthroughs 
may, at long last, fundamentally explain why we age. This 
rapid 
scientific progress 
could 
spawn FDA-approved therapeutics potentially 
in the 
next decade, with the 
primary goal 
of keeping 
us younger and alive 
for 
longer. 


Today, the anti-aging 
market, 
while 
huge 
(~$200 
billion 
globally), is largely restricted 
to non-therapeutics (cosmetic 
products 
and 
procedures).At the same 
time, U.S. 
health spending, which increases 
significantly with age in 
concordance with age-
related diseases (see 
Figure 
8), is 
expected to exceed ~20% of U.S. 
gross 
domestic 
product (GDP) 
by 2025. Thus, with scientific breakthroughs emerging this 
decade 
on the cellular origins 
of why 
the tissues in our body’s 
age, novel anti-aging 
medicines 
may become 
one 
of the next big disruptions in the 
healthcare market. 


Prior Attempts 


There has 
been a range of prior attempts by the Biopharmaceutical 
industry over 
the last several decades to develop anti-aging therapeutics, including the activation 
of so-called sirtuin proteins (via resveratrol, a component found in red wine) and the 
enzyme telomerase (increasing healthy cell 
division 
by 
activating telomerase), 
but 
all the 
studies were unsuccessful (see 
Figure 
9). However, the science 
and 
technology necessary for developing therapies capable of slowing/reversing or 
potentially preventing the onset of age-related diseases has 
advanced dramatically 
in recent years, to a 
point where effective anti-aging 
drugs may soon 
become a 
reality.

Anti-Aging Players 


Many biotech 
companies, including Unity Biotechnology and Calico (a Google 
venture), are developing therapies with the 
goal of extending 
the 
human healthspan 


— 
defined 
as the portion of life lived free of age-related 
disease. These 
companies 
are exploring a number of potentially transformative 
approaches, including 
circulating youth factors, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and the elimination 
of a 
specific 
cell type 
called 
‘senescent cells.’ 
In our view, targeting these 
so-called senescent 
cells, which are 
believed to be 
the 
drivers of numerous 
age-related diseases, 
appears 
to be 
the 
most promising anti-aging approach explored thus far (Figure 
9). 
Unity 
Biotechnology 
is 
developing 
a novel 
class of drugs called ‘senolytics’ 
that are 
specifically 
designed to eliminate senescent cells while 
sparing the normal 
surrounding tissues. Recently, Unity advanced 
its 
first senolytic into 
the 
clinic for 
osteoarthritis of the 
knee, a 
disease 
that affects over 15 
million 
patients in the 
UnitedStates. If successful, senolytics 
could become FDA approved and 
commercially available within the next five 
years (Figure 
10).

senescence), and scientists have

Senescent Cells: 
A Potential Underlying Cause of Age-
Related Disease? 


Senescent cells have 
been shown to accumulate in tissues 
with age and are 
associated with a number of age-related 
diseases, including 
atherosclerosis 
(plaque 
buildup 
in artery walls), arthritis, retinal degeneration, Alzheimer’s 
disease, and 
many forms 
of fibrosis 
(a thickening of connective tissue) 
(Figure 
8). The induction 
of senescence 
is 
thought to be an acute defense mechanism 
against cancer and 
other forms of cellular dysfunction. 
To be 
more specific, in response to 
stress, cells 
can 
permanently stop dividing 
(i.e., 
senescence) and therefore provide a barrier to 
the development of cancer. Senescent cells have also been shown to produce and 
secrete a distinct cocktail 
of pro-inflammatory proteins 
and 
growth factors (Figure 
11). 


It's hypothesized that these secreted factors are programmed to 
(1) induce an 
inflammatory response 
that can stimulate 
the 
clearance 
of nearby damaged or 
potentially cancerous tissue and 
(2) close the 
loop and then 
eliminate acute 
senescent cells 
after their job is done. Unfortunately, things aren’t so 
simple, and 
while the 
senescent cells 
should 
disappear, sometimes 
they 
persist in tissues.

This accumulation of senescent cells can lead to chronic 
senescence (as opposed 
to acute 
senescence), 
and 
scientists 
have discovered that chronic senescence 
drives/contributes 
to age-related diseases. Therefore, 
use of 
drugs that can flush 
out the chronic 
senescent cells looks like 
an attractive therapeutic 
strategy.

Selectively Eliminating Senescent Cells Could Prevent and 
Possibly Reverse 
Age-Related Disease Progression 

Senolytic drugs 
are designed to specifically eliminate chronic senescent cells, which 
could potentially restore treated tissue back 
to normal function (Figure 
12).

In pre-clinical 
animal models, the removal of senescent cells 
prevented the 
onset of 
numerous age-related 
diseases, including arthritis, cataracts, and 
kidney 
dysfunction. Figure 
13 
depicts 
an example 
of an experiment where two mice born in 
the 
same litter were monitored for the development of age-related diseases 
throughout their lifespan. One 
mouse (left) was allowed to 
age normally without any 
pharmacologic 
intervention, 
while 
the 
second mouse (right) was treated with a 
senolytic 
agent to 
periodically eliminate senescent cells. Interestingly, the 
mouse on 
the right receiving the 
senolytic agent appears visibly younger and 
did not develop 
age-related complications 
despite 
being the same age as 
its 
littermate on 
the 
left.

Eliminating senescent cells has been shown 
pre-clinically to prevent the onset of age-
related disease and restore normal tissue 
function 

To further support this finding, numerous other high-profile papers 
conducted 
in 
multiple disease 
models and published in top 
scientific journals (i.e., 
Nature, 
Science) have reached the 
conclusion that eliminating senescent cells prevents the 
onset of age-related disease and restores normal tissue function (see Baker, D. J. 
Nature. 2011 and Chang 
J. Nature Medicine 2016). One study even found that 
clearance of senescent cells led to a 
significant increase (~35%) in 
median 
lifespan 
(Baker, D. J. Nature. 2016). 
Taken together, we believe the preclinical 
evidence 
supporting a role 
for senescent cells 
in 
aging is unusually 
strong.

Studies

Senolytic Therapies 
Have Immense Potential, but Proving 
Safety in Humans Remains 
a Key Question 


Chronic cellular senescence has been 
associated with aging, but 
as alluded 
to 
above, acute cellular senescence remains an 
important biological process 
necessary for cancer surveillance 
and wound 
healing. Therefore, the key questions 
are 
whether treatment with a senolytic could 
(1) cause unforeseen adverse effects 
following the removal of chronic senescent cells and/or (2) disrupt the 
normal 
development of acute senescent cells as needed. While 
clinical data is needed to 
confirm 
safety in 
humans, senolytics have 
demonstrated remarkably clean 
safety 
profiles 
in preclinical animal 
models thus far, with no reported adverse effects 
across 
numerous studies 
in 
separate 
laboratories. For instance, mice that were 
treated with a senolytic were observed to have 
a similar rate 
of cancer incidence as 
their untreated 
counterparts. And senescent cells were found to re-accumulate 
following the withdrawal of the 
senolytic 
treatment, indicating 
that acute senescent 
cell development was not disrupted, a 
key 
positive 
for safety.

t should 
be noted, 
however, that following senolytic treatment, 
wounds healed 
more 
slowly in mice compared to untreated counterparts (Baker et al. Nature. 2016). 
Importantly, the wounds 
healed correctly and thoroughly, but just took 
longer to 
resolve. 
This 
indicates 
that the development of acute 
senescent cells is only briefly 
interrupted following senolytic 
treatment. Nonetheless, to 
sidestep these 
concerns, 
the studies 
being 
conducted by Unity (and presumably other 
senolytic 
drug 
developers) will 
avoid patients 
who have 
recently undergone 
surgery (e.g., 
the risk 
of inadequate/slow 
wound healing 
following senolytic treatment could render 
emergency 
surgery or acute 
injury hazardous, see 
Figure 
14). We 
are expecting the 
first Phase 1 
human proof-of-concept data from Unity in 
the first quarter of 2019 (the 
trial 
began in May 2018; Figure 
9), 
and this 
could 
place the pre-clinical 
data on 
wound-healing risk in better perspective. 


Another important consideration is 
the 
appropriate frequency 
of dosing with a 
senolytic. 
Because 
the accumulation of senescent cells is thought to occur slowly 
over months 
or even years, it is possible that an 
intermittent 
dosing approach could 
be adopted (Figure 
14). Therefore, treatments might be 
administered 
only 
once 
or 
twice a year, or potentially even less frequently, depending 
on the target indication. 
And while speculative ahead 
of initial clinical data, an infrequent dosing 
scheduled 
could limit potential 
safety concerns.

The success of monoclonal antibodies 
underscores the significant commercial 
opportunity in age-related diseases and 
validates the hypothesis that eliminating 
senescent cells could prevent disease 
progression 

Multi-Billion Dollar Monoclonal 
Antibody Franchises 
Could Be Disrupted if Senolytics Come to Market 


Monoclonal antibody therapies such as Humira 
and 
Enbrel (both approved for 
numerous forms 
of arthritis and psoriasis) and Eylea 
and 
Lucentis (both 
approved 
for wet age-related macular degeneration 
and diabetic retinopathy) have become 
multi-billion dollar drugs 
both 
in the U.S. alone 
and worldwide (Figure 
15 
shows 


U.S. sales 
for these representative blockbuster antibodies). Importantly, the 
commercial success of these 
antibodies 
is a key validation for companies targeting 
age-related diseases with anti-aging therapies 
because 
(1) these 
antibody 
franchises 
demonstrate the 
substantial commercial opportunity within these disease 
areas and 
(2) the specific targets of many monoclonal antibodies are, interestingly, 
produced 
directly by senescent cells 
across numerous 
diseased tissues (Coppe 
J. 
P. PLoS Bio. 2008). This implies that treatment with a senolytic therapy 
could 
potentially eliminate 
the 
source of many monoclonal 
antibody 
targets that contribute 
to disease 
progression. If this turns 
out to be 
the 
case, senolytics could achieve at 
least the same 
goals 
as the aforementioned 
antibodies, and 
potentially more as the 
antibodies only target one factor (vs. a 
pool of secretory factors that would go away 
with elimination 
of the chronic 
senescent cells).

First Senolytic Therapy 
Could Be 
Approved by 
2023 


The first senolytic therapy in 
clinical trials is a 
compound 
by Unity, UBX0101, which 
is a 
small-molecule 
drug 
that functions by inducing 
apoptosis (i.e., 
programed cell 
death), 
specifically in senescent cells. The 
company is first testing UBX0101 locally 
in patients with 
moderate 
osteoarthritis of the 
knee, which is 
a substantially large 
market (~17 million 
patients). Initial proof-of-concept data from the Phase 1 trial are 
expected 
in 
the 
first quarter of 2019. If 
successful in later clinical development 
through Phase 
3, UBX0101 
could become 
commercially available 
by 
2023. 

While speculative given 
the 
novelty of the 
senolytic therapeutic strategy, a 
successful therapeutic that could resolve 
osteoarthritic 
knees and return knee 
tissue 
to a 
more youthful state 
could 
have a 
negative impact on 
the 
knee-replacement 
surgery 
market (currently projected 
to grow to >3 million 
knee replacements per 
year by 2030). Because 
other senolytics are being 
developed for multiple 
ophthalmologic (wet AMD, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy) and pulmonary (COPD, 
idiopathic 
pulmonary disease) indications, within the next ~10–20 years patients 
with a range of age-related diseases 
may experience a decreased need for 
therapies 
now considered 
standard of care.
