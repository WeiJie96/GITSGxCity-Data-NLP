1. All-Solid-State Batteries 
ADeterminant for Battery Electric Vehicle 
Uptake 


There is 
no denying 
that the recent boom in battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is 
partly 
the 
result of ideals 
promoted by governments, regulation, and corporate ethics. So 
far, there is no BEV capable 
of meeting 
consumer needs the 
same way 
an internal 
combustion engine (ICE) vehicle 
can, and 
based on the roadmaps announced by 
carmakers, there 
is 
no 
sign that one will emerge 
for the first half of the 2020s. It 
is 
not an easy task to develop a 
BEV that, 
like current ICE vehicles, can be refueled in 
three 
minutes, has a 1,000km 
range 
on one tank 
of fuel, benefits from sufficient 
infrastructure, and can be easily used for at least 10 years. However, the 
emergence of all-solid-state batteries 
may disrupt the current situation and greatly 
accelerate 
market uptake of BEVs. 


When the lithium-ion 
batteries 
that are widely used in smartphones and other 
miniaturized electronic devices are used 
in automotive applications, they require 
much higher demands in terms of safety and 
battery lifespan. At the same 
time, 
there 
is a trade-off between improvements 
in range 
— 
which 
essentially require an 
increase in 
energy density 
— 
and 
safety/lifespan. This trade-off is the 
main reason 
why 
the performance of current lithium-ion batteries is 
seen as a possibly 
insurmountable 
barrier to 
the 
increased market uptake 
of electric vehicles. 


We 
believe all-solid-state batteries 
have the potential to overcome these problems. 
All-solid-state batteries 
have a long history. Solid electrolytes were developed in the 
1970s, but insufficient ionic conductivity limited their application. However, solid 
electrolytes with ionic 
conductivity similar to or superior to liquid electrolytes have 
recently been discovered, accelerating research and development efforts. At the 
2017 Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota announced 
a target for 
commercialization 
for all-
solid-state BEVs 
in the first half of the 2020s. Although the first generation 
of BEVs 
using all-solid-state batteries 
that 
are 
due to 
be launched by 
Toyota will only 
have 
a 
limited 
production volume, the 
announcement by the company 
will undoubtedly 
stimulate increased efforts by 
many companies, researchers, 
and 
government 
bodies in the development of all-solid-state batteries. Volkswagen, Hyundai Motor, 
and Nissan Motor have all announced investments in start-up companies, so we 
see this as a theme likely to benefit from greatly increasing 
attention.

Potential of 
All-Solid-State Batteries 


Current lithium-ion 
batteries are made up of the 
cathode, an 
electrolytic solution, 
a 
separator, 
and the 
anode. The difference 
in a solid-state battery is that the 
electrolyte 
is 
solid. In fact, 
all components and 
materials are 
solid, hence the 
‘solid-
state’ 
terminology. The properties 
of all-solid-state batteries depend on which 
materials are used, but research-to-date reveals 
a clear potential in 
terms of safety, 
resistance to leakage, resistance to combustion (simplified cooling structure), 
miniaturization, flexibility of 
design in 
terms of direct layer formation for cells, relative 
long 
discharge 
cycle lifespan, lack 
of degradation thanks to good high/low 
temperature properties, short charge times, high 
energy density, 
and high power 
density. In the past, 
low power density has been 
seen as a weakness 
of solid-state 
batteries, but the 
Tokyo Institute of Technology and 
Toyota’s research team have 
together developed an all-solid-state battery with three 
times 
the power density and 
twice the energy density of existing lithium-ion batteries. We 
believe 
all-solid-state 
batteries 
have the potential 
to 
overcome the disadvantages of EVs.

All-solid-state batteries are highly fire-resistant and very safe as they have no leakage 
Lithium-ion is the only molecule that moves within the electrolyte and side-effects on the positive electrode surface are therefore unlikely. This lengthens battery life

Resistance to high temperatures allows the cooling structure to be simplified 
Cell design allows a high degree of flexibility 
Cells can be stacked directly on top of one another without packaging

Impact of Market Uptake of All-Solid-State Batteries 


The main impacts 
of all-solid-state batteries on 
the auto 
industry include 
an 
acceleration in BEV market uptake 
and 
changes in the BEV battery supply chain. If 
BEVs replace ICE vehicles, there would be no 
need for engines, transmissions, and 
related parts, but there would 
be a new need for batteries, inverters, motors, and 
parts related to these systems. For conventional auto assemblers, which 
manufacture 
engines and transmissions in-house, ensuring that they have the 
capacity to develop all-solid-state batteries 
in-house is an important source of 
added value. For suppliers, it will be important to re-examine elemental 
technologies to develop new components. If there is an increase 
in BEV market 
uptake, there 
are 
also 
likely to 
be changes to national-level rules 
governing things 
such as taxes, energy policy, 
and resources. 

Ashift from liquid lithium-ion 
batteries to all-solid-state batteries would also mean 
a 
change from 
liquid 
electrolytes to solid electrolytes 
and a decrease in the need for 
separators, 
and there would 
be the 
potential to use new materials for cathodes 
and 
anodes. We think it likely that the materials used in the all-solid-state batteries to 
be 
launched by 
Toyota 
in the first half of the 2020s will be 
similar to those 
used 
currently, and 
as 
production volumes will be small, the impact on the current supply 
chain is also 
likely to 
be 
small. However, if we see material 
progress in 
research 
and development 
efforts, the all-solid-state batteries 
available in the 
second 
half of 
the 2020s and the 2030s 
are likely to 
be 
disruptive.

Barriers to Market-Uptake of All-Solid-State Batteries 


There has 
been talk of a 
bias to BEVs, but the current market consensus is that we 
are now in an era of ‘powertrain diversification’ 
rather than the coming of age 
of 
BEVs as such. However, 
we think 
that if efforts to develop volume 
production of all-
solid-state 
batteries are successful, the era of the BEV could be close. 

Even so, a range of issues 
would 
need 
to be overcome. Research and development 
aimed at the volume production of all-solid-state 
batteries has only just begun, and 
how far manufacturing 
costs 
will decline is 
still 
unclear. Theoretically, there should 
be considerable potential for costs to decline, given the simplification of battery 
packs 
and the use 
of low-cost electrode materials. 


On the other hand, 
if there is greater-than-expected 
progress in the improvement of 
lithium-ion 
battery performance and 
increased 
reductions in 
cost, the shift to all-
solid-state 
batteries could be 
delayed. 

There is 
also the risk that interest in BEVs 
themselves 
could 
fade because of 
developments 
in 
hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) 
and standard 
ICE vehicles, the 
debate around well-to-wheel issues, and the renewed popularity of diesel vehicles 


— 
all 
of which 
could 
mean a weakening in 
development efforts for all-solid-state 
batteries. 
From the perspective of range 
and the time required 
for hydrogen refueling, fuel-cell 
vehicles are another potential 
competitor. Although 
infrastructure issues 
are 
a 
problem, there is considerable potential in terms of a fossil-fuel substitute and 
energy carriage. KPMG’s GlobalAutomotive Executive 2018 
survey ranked fuel-cell 
vehicles 
as the 
top key trend through 2025 and BEVs 
in the 
3rd 
position 
according 
to global automotive executives. In 
2017, the same survey had the issues reversed, 
with BEV’s in the 
No. 1 
position and 
fuel-cell vehicles 
ranked 
3rd.
