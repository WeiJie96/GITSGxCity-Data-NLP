8. Floating Offshore Wind Farms 
The Sea’s the Limit 


Current offshore wind turbines are restricted to 
sea 
depths 
of less than 50 meters, 
significantly restricting where they can 
be 
installed. Floating turbines 
could 
substantially increase the geographic 
coverage of offshore 
wind, including to areas 
with very deep coast lines 
like 
the 
West coast of the U.S. 
and Japan, and enabling 
development into deeper waters in Europe’s North Sea. 


Offshore wind installations today account for <4% of total wind installations, with the 
majority of the wind energy installed base 
being onshore. With onshore being 
saturated 
in 
many developed countries 
due to land 
availability and current offshore 
technology being limited 
only to relatively shallow depths, floating offshore 
could 
substantially increase the addressable market size 
for wind, allowing governments 
to hit 
their renewable energy targets. Floating offshore turbines could also 
be 
installed ‘out of sight', and 
so 
get around 
‘not in 
my backyard’ 
(NIMBYism) 
in wind 
farms, 
which are to some 
seen as visually unappealing. 


Some 
Background 


Wind 
power generation is a 
key part in 
achieving government targets for renewable 
energy, and following years of higher volumes and declining 
costs, onshore wind 
power is now cost competitive 
compared 
with 
thermal 
power in many regions. 
Onshore wind 
is, 
however, 
now seeing 
signs of market saturation in 
certain 
developed 
markets 
— 
especially in 
markets like the U.K., 
where restrictive planning 
laws introduced in 2015 have 
substantially curtailed new developments. 
This has 
driven a 
growing focus on 
offshore wind turbines, 
which enable both 
larger 
structures (hence more power) and the use 
of the seabed as 
opposed 
to land. 

Traditional offshore wind 
turbines are essentially larger versions of their onshore 
brethren, 
but they rely on 
shallow 
waters in 
order to be fixed to the 
seabed. 
This 
has 
prompted the 
idea of a floating offshore wind-turbine. 
The floating offshore wind-
turbine has two key advantages over the fixed structure, namely access to more 
productive wind conditions (as better wind conditions tend to 
be further out at sea), 
and being further ‘out of sight’, away from residential areas. 

The concept of floating 
offshore is 
not new, but 
the first demonstrator’s 
being 
commissioned in Scotland in 2017, the announcement of a demonstrator in Japan 
in 2018, and the 
creation 
of a 
development consortium in California, also this year, 
suggest the 
technology is on 
the verge 
of adoption.

A floating offshore wind-farm in Scotland 
currently powers 20,000 households 

Japan launched an experimental turbine in 
2013 and is currently considering developing 
a floating offshore wind-farm 

A 100–150MW floating offshore wind farm is 
proposed off the coast of California by 2024 

How It Works 


The turbine is mounted on a 
cylinder filled with ballast, while 
'anchors' (essentially 
large weights, often 100,000+ tonnes each) are 
attached to the cylinder to 
stabilize 
it 
on 
a deeper-water seabed point. Cables 
connected to the turbine transport power 
to shore. 


How Close to Reality? 


The first-ever floating offshore 
wind-farm was installed and connected in 
late 2017, 
located 
25km off the 
coast ofAberdeenshire, Scotland. The 
wind farm involved the 
installation of five 6 
megawatt (MW) 
wind turbines 
manufactured by Siemens-
Gamesa, and 
it 
has powered 20,000 
households in the U.K. 
since its launch. With a 
capacity factor (which 
measures actual production versus 
nameplate/maximum 
capacity) of 65% achieved in 
the first three 
months, this figure far surpasses 
existing 
onshore wind farms 
(generally around 
30% 
capacity 
factor). 

Japan has also been a 
country aggressively seeking floating 
wind-power options 
due to the depth of its waters (~80% 
of the country's estimated wind resource is 
deemed to be 
in 
deeper water areas). The country launched its first experimental 
commercial-scale floating wind turbine (2MW) in 2013 
off the 
coast of Kabashima 
Island, and 
it has recently shown 
progress for an actual utility-scale wind farm with 
France's Ideol 
and 
Japan's 
Acacia Renewables signing 
an 
memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) 
for the development of Japan's first floating offshore wind-
farm, although 
construction 
isn't expected to 
start until 
2023. 

In the U.S., the Redwood Coast EnergyAuthority (RCEA) recently selected a 
consortium (including EDPR Offshore NorthAmerica andAker Solutions) for a 
proposed 
100–150MW floating offshore project 20 
miles off the coast of Eureka, 
California. 
The consortium is aiming to complete 
and 
connect the wind farm by 
2024.

Floating wind turbines are gest beginning to 
be recognized and adopted 

How 
Well Known? 


Being 
at a relatively nascent stage of adoption, floating wind 
turbines are “beginning 
to gain popularity worldwide, already having been 
adopted 
in countries like Norway, 
Portugal and Japan”, according to GE. France has also recently turned toward 
floating 
offshore, with the current renewable energy plan (PPE) aiming for 100MW 
of marine energy (including 
floating wind turbines) to 
be installed 
by 2023. The 
country is also currently in the 
process of installing 
a 24MW 
test pilot 
project off the 
coast of the 
Leucate/Le Barcares area, which is 
expected 
be 
completed in 
2020. 

The Offshore division CEO of Siemens-Gamesa, the world's 
#1 offshore wind 
turbine OEM, stated that it 
views 
the floating wind-farm market “the same way we 
did with (fixed) offshore wind farms 
in the early beginning… 
an initially niche market 
that may develop over time into a large 
market,” and 
that the catalyst for this 
market 
to grow bigger would be the cost competitiveness aspect versus 
the fixed 
foundation platform. 

How Big Could the 
Opportunity Be? 


Addressable market 


The floating offshore wind-market addresses a wide range of water depths of up to 
200 
meters, giving 
it a 
much larger potential 
than 
fixed foundation turbines. The 
Carbon 
Trust estimates 
that the majority of offshore wind resource is only utilizable 
through floating offshore structures. Northern European countries 
including the 
U.K., Germany, 
and Denmark 
have been pioneers 
in using traditional offshore 
in the 
North Sea, but over half of the 
North 
Sea 
is 
at depths inaccessible for traditional 
offshore, but accessible for floating offshore.

adoption

Estimates for addressable 
markets vary widely by source, and there is a big 
difference between addressable (sea bed of 60-200 metres) and economically 
viable 
— 
the 
latter point will 
subject to turbine pricing, subsidies, and the 
costs and 
complexities 
of grid 
connection. 

Europe 
has the 
largest potential for floating offshore power, with 66% of the North 
Sea being 
between 50–220m 
deep. 
The EWEA estimates 
that by 2050, if this deep 
water space is utilized 
then this could meet the EU's electricity consumption four 
times over. 


The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has conducted various 
studies 
predicting the potential 
for floating 
offshore in the U.S. One example is 
in California 
(the state with the largest economy within the country), where 
the 
NREL estimates 
95% of the state's 
offshore wind resources 
are in 60m+ depths, 
with a potential of 
more than 
100GW. 


Japan has the sixth-largest sea space 
globally, with one source estimating 
1,600GW 
of potential for the 
country, although the majority of the 
surrounding 
seas 
are >60m deep. The Japanese 
Wind Power Association (JWPA) estimates around 
620GW 
potential 
capacity for offshore wind, with 
520GW 
for floating 
offshore alone. 
Based 
on this, the JWPAset a roadmap targeting 
17.5GW 
of floating 
offshore 
installations 
by 
2050. 

Consultant 
MAKE forecasts that some 
3.4GW 
of floating wind power could be 
installed by 2030 globally, and 
the European 
Wind EnergyAssociation (EWEA) 
estimates that by 2050 
offshore wind capacity in Europe 
could reach 460GW 
(which 
would 
be roughly 
sufficient for providing 50% of power demands) through 
deployment of deep 
offshore designs (i.e., 
floating offshore). 


Barriers to Adoption 


• 
Subsidies: 
As with most renewable energy 
sources, wind energy has relied 
on 
government subsidies, usually in the form of guaranteed Feed-in 
Tariffs or Tax 
Credits, in the 
early 
stages of adoption, and we think floating offshore would be 
no different. 
Despite the U.K. 
being at the forefront of floating wind power adoption, under the 
current system floating wind farms will be eligible for subsidies 
only 
if they start 
generating power before October of this year. 
Trade association RenewableUK 
had officially called for the U.K. 
government to give an 
additional 
grace period of 
18 months, although 
the 
government ruled out any amendments to the current 
structure, 
citing the 
need for the technology to 
be 
more 
cost competitive.

Battery storage and UHVDC connectors are 
two solutions to wind intermittency 

The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) levels 
of floating 
offshore wind are widely 
expected to 
go down, although it may be a 
long time 
before it gets near cost 
competitiveness 
compared 
with 
other renewables. WindEurope forecasts LCOEs 
of floating offshore 
to decline 
38% by 2050, and this rate of decline 
is 
similar to 
onshore (-35% by 2050) and 
fixed offshore (-41%). Equinor, operator of the 
Hywind floating offshore wind farm, aims to reach LCOE levels of €40-60/MWh 
for the wind farm by 2030 (levels 
that are 
comparable to current onshore wind 
LCOE levels). 

• 
Intermittency: Wind 
power, similar to 
other renewable energy sources, 
is 
disadvantaged 
by 
intermittency in nature (i.e., 
wind does not 
blow all the time). 
To compensate, there are various 
solutions 
that are under development, such 
as 
battery storage and 
ultra-high-voltage 
direct current (UHVDC) 
connectors (to 
balance with other uncorrelated renewable sources like solar). Utility-scale 
storage solutions are still in 
their nascent stage of adoption 
and are generally 
considered to be expensive, although costs are expected 
to come 
down as these 
solutions become 
more prevalent. 
Winners and Losers 
Winners 

• 
Turbine OEMs: 
Floating 
offshore technology presents new opportunities 
for the 
global wind turbine OEM players, especially to those 
that 
currently have 
exposure to the fixed offshore 
business. 
• 
HVDC 
/ cable / interconnects: 
There are a few different types of cables and 
equipment involved in the power transmission process. Inter array cables interconnect 
the 
turbines within the wind farm, through which electricity generated 
goes through to the transformer. From the transformer the 
electricity goes 
through export cables, which 
then 
are delivered to 
shore. Given the longer 
distance of floating offshore turbines from 
shore, cable costs 
will be of much 
more 
significance, especially when considering 
that it costs 
around $2 
million/km 
for an HVDC cable. 
• 
Energy storage: 
The intermittent nature 
of wind power necessitates increased 
means of energy storage 
to 
compensate. The 
most recent example of a large-
scale battery project is 
Tesla's 
100MW-scale 'giant battery' connected to 
a 
325MW wind farm in SouthAustralia, with the battery cost estimated to be 
around $50 
million. IRENA estimates that global battery storage technology 
could 
reach 
175GW 
in 
2030 
(a 
17-fold increase 
from the 
2GW 
in 
2017). 
Losers 

• 
Fossil 
/ nuclear power generation: 
Further technological development and 
reduction in 
the 
cost of renewable energy indubitably shifts demand away from 
traditional fossil fuels 
and nuclear power, leading to unfavorable prospects for 
manufacturers of related equipment.
