Dynamic Spectrum Access 
Potential Airbnb/Uber Style Disruption in the $1 Trillion 
Wireless Industry 


All wireless communications services use electromagnetic radiation — from a 
simple TV remote or cellular phone up to a satellite. For wireless transmission to 
work, the transmitter and receiver need to be tuned to the same frequency, and no 
other device should use close-by frequencies (spectrum band) at a particular point 
in time and space. Otherwise a clash, also called interference, occurs. Spectrum by 
default belongs to national governments. While some spectrum bands, such as 
those used for WiFi, are free to be used by anyone, to avoid the possibility of 
interference between different users of the same band, some spectrum bands are 
allocated exclusively. 

Such a framework creates a small group of entities exclusively licensed to use 
spectrum on a nationwide basis. This is similar to having a small number of hotels 
or taxi companies exclusively licensed to operate in a particular city. The rationale 
for such exclusive licensing usually includes security and reliability of service. 
Innovative technologies like those used by Airbnb and Uber address some of the 
security and reliability challenges and in turn are able to disrupt the licensed 
businesses model, possibly making it obsolete. Interference, and hence security 
and reliability, in wireless communications depend on a range of factors including 
the power and density of transmitters, frequency bands, landscape, and the design 
of buildings. Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), also known as Dynamic Spectrum 
Management (DSM), is a technology-empowered framework with the potential to 
address these complex factors. It allows multiple users to share a particular countrywide 
spectrum band, ideally in a secure and reliable way. This boosts the efficiency 
of spectrum utilization and opens wireless opportunities to larger number of players, 
possibly similar to Airbnb property owners and Uber drivers. 


Paradox of the Wireless Industry’s Design 


In market economies, there are two groups of assets: private assets that are 
privately controlled, ideally unregulated, and tradeable (e.g., commodities, 
properties, consumer products and intellectual rights), and shared assets which are 
often publicly controlled and heavily regulated (e.g., roads, airports, electricity 
networks, armed forces, and in the future perhaps certain technology platforms). 
We see shared assets as being sensible in three cases. The first is for natural 
monopolies that are prone to sharing, with practically unlimited capacity and 
adverse consequences if there is duplication, e.g. roads or armed forces. The 
second is linked to universal service, e.g., the need to connect all homes to an 
electricity network of a certain standard. The third is linked to industrial policies, 
which intentionally suppress or fail to encourage local competition in specific areas 
to build national advantages in global competition, e.g. infrastructure and 
technology platforms. 


The emergence of mass-market wireless technologies has led people to question 
how spectrum should be treated. Historically, spectrum was a shared asset used by 
public services such as radio, TV, security, or anybody else in unlicensed bands 
(used today for example for WiFi). Later on, as part of the ‘creation’ of the wireless 
industry, some spectrum was set aside, divided into a small number of pan-national 
exclusively-licensed bands with long-term validity, often with prescribed technology, 
type of service, and agreed territorial coverage. This spectrum was then exclusively 
awarded to future wireless operators.

… 
but can the wireless industry, with its 
‘privileged’ 
access to spectrum, now be 
falling victim to its own success and hitting 
the limits of its own design? 

Questions about network and spectrum 
sharing are increasingly pertinent in the 
context of IoT and 5G 

DSA uses advanced technologies to boost 
efficiency of spectrum utilization by enabling 
spectrum-sharing among multiple users 

To encourage capital inflow into this new industry, policymakers chose to treat 
wireless 
as 
a competitive 
industry and refrained 
from major regulations. 

Unlike the technology 
industry, which usually evolves 
spontaneously around 
innovative 
ideas, the wireless industry was basically design-made by policy-makers 
as part of their effort to build territorial wireless 
coverage and 
deliver specific 
services (e.g., 
voice 
and 
messaging) as fast as possible. 

The wireless 
industry has undoubtedly 
been 
successful in fulfilling 
its 
objectives. 
The vast majority of the world’s population now benefits 
from mobile 
coverage 
(there 
are currently 
5.2 
billion 
unique mobile users, 
equal to 
70% of the world’s 
population), 
and data 
speeds 
are continuously rising. However, unless the wireless 
industry 
can develop 
new major technology and service-driven growth opportunities 
(we call them DIGITECCS: 
Digital 
Technology, Connectivity 
and Service), it may in 
our view fall victim 
to 
its 
own success, by simply fulfilling 
the 
objectives it was 
created for. The design-made 
nature 
of the wireless 
industry 
is increasingly leading 
to 
the 
need 
for non-systemic regulatory interventions 
that 
tackle 
oligopolies, 
coverage/quality issues, 
and 
the 
inefficient use of spectrum. This raises 
the 
question about the 
benefits 
of the currently-established 
spectrum ownership 
privileges 
of a 
specific 
industry with a specific 
business model. 

In a 
June 2018 
report Is the wireless industry facing disruption?: SouthAfrica, 5G, 
DSA and DIGITECCS inspired debate about wireless 
we 
highlighted 
three key 
opportunities for wireless expansion: (1) uncovered 
areas, (2) areas with low-quality 
coverage, 
and 
(3) the use 
of small cells for industrial 
innovation. It 
is 
not particularly 
clear to us that the existing model of multiple 
competing 
nationwide wireless 
networks, as leading 
spectrum owners, is best suited 
to address 
any 
of 
these. It 
may appear that designers of the wireless industry wanted to 
‘square the 
circle’ 
by 
creating 
a private unregulated 
industry to provide what is increasingly turning into a 
public 
service with extensive government-prescribed coverage and 
quality targets 
and obligations. It also appears that the 
providers 
of this 
service 
may at least in 
some areas 
benefit from 
the 
concept of asset 
sharing (due to, for example, 
natural 
monopolies in 
passive 
infrastructure, 
desirability of some form of universal 
service, 
and industrial policy interests in security and 
infrastructure investments 
for the 
digital economy). Hence, 
questions about whether spectrum 
and networks 
should 
be shared, and to what degree, remain relevant, especially since wireless 
growth is 
becoming scarcer and 
5G/IoT is prompting 
the 
need 
for a policy re-think. 


What Is DSA and How 
Can It 
Disrupt? 


As we already discussed, spectrum is a finite resource, the 
sharing of which may 
cause interference 
challenges 
and ultimately degrade the wireless 
connection 
quality. This is why certain bands are exclusively assigned to 
the wireless operators 
nationwide. However, these 
exclusive spectrum users 
have 
a natural economic 
incentive to utilize their spectrum more 
efficiently in 
areas 
that are 
more 
economically attractive 
than others. Meanwhile, other (potentially more 
innovative) 
users may not have access to 
spectrum 
at all, even in areas 
where it is not utilized 
by the exclusive owners. In addition, some spectrum 
cannot be utilized 
because of 
its 
sporadic use by government institutions, for example by the armed forces. 

DSA is a technology-empowered 
framework designed to address 
these 
challenges 
by using innovative ways of sharing 
spectrum bands among 
multiple users, based 
on 
technologies such 
as 
software, game 
theory, machine learning, 
and artificial 
intelligence (AI). DSA may offer the 
following capabilities:

1. Dynamic spectrum re-allocation between users: 
Spectrum in 
specific 
locations and time points can 
be flexibly allocated using 
a 
tiered system where 
‘spectrum holders’ 
are assigned priorities as opposed 
to exclusivity to 
use 
spectrum. Spectrum 
can 
be flexibly reallocated to a 
diverse set of entities, 
which avoid 
collision by knowing each 
other’s needs and flexibly managing 
channels (cognitive radio) 
and transmission power. 
2. Use of imperfect (not entirely interference-clean) spectrum channels: 
Software-based technologies 
exist, which could 
increase reliability and 
data 
throughput of imperfect channels 
by mitigating 
interference-related 
imperfections. 
These 
technologies are well 
known to the telecom 
industry, 
because 
they are widely used 
to prop up 
performance 
of copper-based 
fixed-
line 
channels, e.g., 
vectoring and 
G.fast. In theory, similar solutions 
could be 
deployed in wireless as well. 
Should the wireless industry brace itself for So far, 
DSAhas been 
primarily focused on utilizing underutilized 
and 
sporadically 
DSA-driven Airbnb-and Uber-style used spectrum 
and 
in the cleanup of interference but 
not necessarily 
in 
disruptive 
disruption? ways. Wireless operators 
could in fact benefit from DSA, which gives them 
an 


opportunity to acquire priority 
access to 
more spectrum 
in 
specific territories. 
However, we think that DSA can also 
strengthen 
momentum behind regional, 
community, municipal, 
and corporate wireless networks, which have so far been 
operated on unlicensedWiFi spectrum. 
This 
may disrupt the 
wireless 
industry in the 
following ways: 


1. Creation of a shared wireless economy: 
Technological 
progress has led to 
the 
emergence of shared 
economies in areas 
such as accommodation and 
transportation. By making spectrum more widely available, 
DSA could fragment 
the wireless 
market 
and 
possibly lead 
to 
similar opportunities. This could 
create 
shared economies with 
multiple providers of connectivity (accessing spectrum 
through DSA and connecting radio 
antennas, 
for example, 
to national fiber 
networks, similar to 
the 
use 
of public roads by Uber cars or water supply in 
Airbnb 
properties) and 
multiple users (e.g., 
people with devices, which allow 
connecting 
to such networks). 
The phenomenon of small localized networks 
is 
not new in telecoms; examples range from 
metropolitan 
WiFi to local fiber 
networks. DSAcould, however, give 
these 
networks key attributes that they 
have been missing so far: 
spectrum, 
and subsequently compatibility with the 
mainstream wireless technology such as 4G and 5G. 
2. Changes 
in regulation 
to limit availability of nationwide exclusive 
spectrum: 
DSA opportunities 
raise two crucial 
questions for the policymakers. 
(a) Should low-frequency bands occupied by non-telecom users such as 
TV 
also 
be 
made available on a DSA-shared basis? (b) Should frequency bands, 
particularly those above 3.5GHz 
where blanket nationwide 
coverage is 
impractical, be allocated on 
a 
DSA-priority basis instead 
of 
an 
exclusivity 
basis? 
If the DSA technology proves reliable, it would be hard to argue against 
these suggestions. However, if these 
concepts 
are adopted, the wireless 
industry may over time lose 
its privilege to use crucial 
spectrum exclusively, 
i.e., 
it may no longer be able to prevent disruption 
by withholding 
access to 
spectrum from potential 
disruptors.

The first major DSA project, CBRS, is 
currently under way in the U.S. 

3. Creation of an 
alternative model for 5G 
small-cell deployments: 
Wireless 
operators 
usually see 5G/IoT small cells 
(operator-controlled 
low-powered 
mobile base stations) as 
their 
crucial 
growth opportunity. We 
see 
commercial 
small-cell opportunities first emerging 
in industrial innovation (e.g., 
coverage 
of 
production plants) and services (e.g., 
coverage 
of airports, hotels, 
entertainment parks, 
etc.) Purpose-built networks accessing 
spectrum via DSA 
(as opposed to parallel 
competing 
networks 
using exclusive 
countrywide 
spectrum) would seem sensible in 
many cases. 
These 
networks 
may be 
built 
by industrial or service companies, tech 
companies, and 
small/medium 
enterprises 
as a 4G/5G-compatible upgrade of WiFi-based 
solutions. Even 
though owners of such 
networks 
may 
have to respect priority rights of other 
users to 
their spectrum, in 
practice this 
constraint may be manageable, 
because we are often talking 
about short-range indoor installations. Priority 
users may often not even have physical access 
to 
these 
indoor areas. In an 
extreme case, the wireless 
market may re-shape toward territorially 
fragmented, localized high-capacity networks with relatively high efficiency of 
spectrum utilization under DSA. Meanwhile, nationwide coverage, for example 
for voice, Internet access, 
and 
secured 
data 
services, may eventually lean 
toward a public service 
using 
nationwide spectrum. 
4. Dilution of some of the unique skills of wireless operators: 
Good wireless 
operators 
usually stand out in two areas: (a) their ability to acquire 
spectrum 
so 
that the 
benefits 
of owning 
it outweigh its costs and related obligations 
as 
much 
as possible 
and 
(b) their ability to build 
networks, i.e., 
add sites at the right pace 
and to the right locations to maximize returns. DSA may bring more 
transparency 
and fragmentation to the spectrum markets and hence reduce 
potential advantages of specific operators. Moreover, it is 
possible 
that the 
tech 
industry may 
gain 
quality big-data on subscriber locations, geographies etc., 
which together withAI may allow it to develop 
‘network planning 
skills’ 
and 
similar toAirbnb or Uber 
‘manage’ 
networks with capacity provided by 
a large 
number of smaller entities. 
The tech 
industry has already been 
involved 
in 
several 
attempts to dilute the 
unique 
nature 
of the wireless 
industry’s skills. 
This 
involves, for example, localWiFi 
networks, WiMax, soft SIMs, 
or mobile virtual 
network operators (MVNOs). None of 
this, however, has led to 
major breakthroughs. This may be because 
opportunities 
for the to-be-disruptors 
may not have 
been 
big 
enough 
for them to invest sufficient 
amounts 
of energy or due 
to the practical 
obstacles. In 
the future, 5G/IoT 
may bring 
the opportunities while DSA could help 
overcome 
some of the obstacles. 


How Close 
Is DSAto 
Reality? 


The DSA concept has 
been known for years, but a 
number of 
barriers have so far 
delayed 
major deployments. The technology 
still needs to 
go a long way to prove its 
ability to 
significantly 
have an 
impact on 
global 
Technology, Media & Telecom (TMT) 
markets.According 
to the Dynamic Spectrum 
Alliance, 
there 
are currently several 
dozen 
DSA-localized deployments 
spread over all major continents, mostly using 
TV white space (spectrum allocated for 
TV broadcast, but practically unused 
in 
some bands and territories) for local broadband. Taking 
this to the 
next level, the 
CBRS (Citizens 
Broadband Radio Service) shared-spectrum scheme is currently 
being introduced in the United 
States. It 
is 
meant to be 
suitable for LTE phones, 
indoor coverage, 
and 
small cells. 
The scheme will initially operate on a 
150MHz 
block in the 3.5GHz band, using DSA to 
create a 
priority-based system for multiple 
users of the 
same spectrum (also 
see transcript of our interview 
with CEO of 
Federated 
Wireless, which 
is 
involved in 
this project:

Wireless

CBRS is a priority-driven scheme, which 
allows multiple users to access the same 
spectrum bands 

DSA is a global story for years to come, but 
potency of the technology, backing by the 
big tech industry, and the need for a policy 
re-think ahead of 5G are already making it 
strategically relevant 

Potential of DSA is not yet widely 
recognized 

The first priority to the CBRS spectrum will 
go to 
the 
original 
users such 
as 
the 
Navy. Subsequently, other entities 
could 
buy second-p0riority access to 
some 
of this 
spectrum in PriorityAccess License (PAL) auctions. Finally, spectrum 
left vacant by 
the second priority users is 
open to 
a broader range of users. CBRS is expected to 
help 
in fixed-wireless access 
and 
densification of the wireless networks, but also in 
a variety of new use 
cases 
such as 
indoor small 
cells 
in 
buildings, in public 
spaces, 
and in 
industrial 
premises (for IoT). Due to 
the relatively short range of small 
cells it 
may not be practical for priority users 
to perform physical deployments 
in 
many 
areas, leaving this opportunity 
under DSAto other parties. 
The scheme is expected 
to be 
operational 
late this year 
or early next year. 

The success of CBRS is in 
our 
view crucial for further spread of the technology 
globally. Practically, it may take years for DSA to more significantly influence the 
way spectrum 
is 
allocated 
or managed 
around the world. However, we see the 
following 
grounds 
to believe that DSA may be already 
strategically relevant: 


• 
Theoretical potential of DSA: 
In the 5G/IoT environment and digital economies, 
importance of spectrum 
is 
likely to rise. DSA can theoretically lead to 
substantial 
improvements in spectrum utilization in three ways. Firstly, by allowing 
multiple 
users to 
use the 
same 
spectrum by managing 
to avoid interference. Secondly, by 
fragmenting and hence boosting 
the 
competitive 
efficiency of the wireless 
markets. 
Thirdly, in the 
longer 
term, by deploying technologies to 
boost 
performance even with some 
channel interference. In addition, DSA allows 
the 
use 
of spectrum without an expensive 
‘cleaning process,’ 
i.e., 
without covering 
the 
cost of equipment, 
for example, 
for military users. Finally, 
a 
significant part of 
industrial connectivity innovation has so far been taking place on 
WLAN (WiFi) as 
opposed 
to the wireless operators’ networks. DSAhas 
the 
potential to 
further 
expand such innovation. 
• 
Tech industry’s backing: 
The CBRS ecosystem was originally founded by 
companies 
such as Qualcomm, Nokia, Ericsson, Intel, Google, 
and Federated 
Wireless. The Dynamic Spectrum 
Alliance is currently backed by a number of 
tech 
companies including Google, Amazon (joined 
in 
June 2018), Microsoft, 
and 
Facebook. We think that success 
of DSA is reasonably 
strategically important for 
the tech 
industry, because it would 
increase the available bandwidth (hence 
potential use of software/tech 
products) 
and 
create 
opportunities 
for tech 
companies 
to 
manage 
spectrum allocation, but also reduce 
the ability of the 
wireless 
companies to 
act as 
gatekeepers. Given 
the 
high valuations 
and recent 
stock 
market volatility in tech, we think that DSA is likely to become even more 
pertinent for the tech 
industry, 
• 
Need to review spectrum 
allocation policies 
ahead of 5G: 
Finally, spectrum 
allocation 
debates, particularly in high frequency bands for 5G small-cell 
coverage, 
will become highly relevant in the coming years. If the DSA arguments 
gain 
momentum, the 
technology may disrupt the wireless industry even 
before 
the 
completion 
of large-scale rollouts, simply by limiting the 
wireless 
industry’s 
ability to acquire 
spectrum exclusively. 
How 
Well 
Known 
Is DSA to the Market? 


Our recent conversations with 
telecom operators and investors show that DSA is 
not yet widely known and understood by the market. 
While investors’ awareness 
of 
the technology is relatively low, wireless operators know it, but — 
with the possible 
exception of those 
in 
the U.S. 
— 
they do 
not yet see it as 
material in 
their strategic 
planning. That said, some open-minded regulators including 
the FCC (U.S.), Ofcom 
(U.K.), and 
ICASA (SouthAfrica) have been 
pursuing DSA related opportunities.

The ultimate aim of DSA — 
spectrum 
abundance — 
may have an impact on 
wireless and spectrum assets worth trillions 
of dollars in the course of boosting the digital 
economy 

DSA should lower the cost of wireless 
connectivity and boost innovation 

Restraining 
the 
wireless 
industry’s 
‘spectrum 
privileges’ 
would be a major policy move 
and would naturally attract opposition 

How Big Can the DSAOpportunity Be? 


Spectrum 
is the 
key asset of the global wireless industry, whose 
revenue 
is 
in 
the 
range 
of $1 
trillion, meaning the enterprise 
value of the world’s wireless operators 
can 
be estimated in 
the 
single 
trillions 
of dollars. The U.S., which accounts for 
nearly a 
quarter of the 
global 
economy, generates more than 
$200 
billion 
in wireless 
revenue. 
The total value of licensed spectrum 
in 
the U.S. 
is around 
$0.5 
trillion 
(source CTIA 2015, adjusted), indicating that all spectrum 
may be worth trillions 
of 
dollars 
globally. This spectrum 
value is naturally driven 
by supply, demand (how it is 
used), the 
conditions under which 
it is awarded, 
etc. The ultimate 
aim around DSA, 
spectrum abundance, may affect the global wireless 
industry by reducing entry 
barriers to owning spectrum and inviting 
new companies 
into the 
market.As a 
result, some spectrum value 
may shift away from the taxpayer (governments 
charging 
for spectrum) and the wireless 
operators (owners of spectrum) toward the 
broader economy (including business users) and the tech industry. 

Estimating DSA’s disruptive effect on the wireless industry and its broader positive 
economic benefits is difficult at this early stage, although 
the 
Dynamic Spectrum 
Alliance, 
for example, 
shows a 
$0.5 
trillion estimate 
of economic surplus of the U.S. 
unlicensed (WiFi) spectrum today. 
DSA is likely to gain 
momentum especially if it 
proves its reliability and shows its 
broader economic benefits 
outweigh its 
costs and 
disruptive effects. We see its 
economic benefits 
in the following categories. 


• 
Lowering of costs 
and boosting capacity of wireless 
connectivity by (a) utilizing 
heavily underutilized spectrum currently used 
by governments and (b) boosting 
sharing of private spectrum; and 
• 
Fueling innovation 
by opening 
wireless 
markets to 
new players. 
What Are the Barriers to DSAAdoption? 


Despite being 
known for many years, DSA is 
still in early stages 
of its deployment. 
This is, inter alia, 
due 
to various uncertainties and barriers. Below we highlight the 
most crucial ones: 


1. Security, execution, cost, 
and technology-availability issues: 
Any 
spectrum sharing naturally raises interference and hence communications-
quality and 
security risks. DSA is designed to 
tackle these. 
That said, any 
DSA 
system will naturally face risks 
and 
technological 
challenges 
and incur costs. 
Experience from 
the 
first major deployments 
such as CBRS will be crucial for 
the technology to gain 
momentum and hence scale economies in the 
equipment market. 
2. Opposition 
against ending 
wireless industry’s spectrum 
‘privileges’:As 
we said 
earlier, the wireless industry was essentially designed around exclusive 
use 
of spectrum. Hence, 
by default it has become the key owner of licensed 
spectrum. We therefore expect the 
industry 
to 
push for continued 
exclusive 
spectrum allocation on 
the 
grounds of quality, security, network investment 
incentives, 
etc. The 
industry is also likely to aim at taking 
‘ownership’ 
of the 
spectrum debate, possibly arguing 
that spectrum 
sharing 
is 
not a new idea and 
promoting its own sharing models. Equipment vendors 
may also want to show 
restraint from 
pushing a technology with 
the 
potential to disrupt businesses of 
their key customers.

3. Need for major policy changes leading to possibly lower national budget 
revenues from 
spectrum sales: 
DSA would require a 
major departure from 
the existing model of exclusive spectrum allocation. It may meaningfully 
increase 
the 
supply of spectrum capacity, prevent wireless operators from 
hoarding 
spectrum to avoid 
disruption, 
and allocate spectrum to smaller players 
at low cost. 
Therefore, it may 
dilute 
the 
revenues 
a government can expect to 
raise from spectrum 
auctions. 
This may pose 
a challenge of finding other ways 
to raise tax revenue from 
TMT. 
4. Dependence on a strong push by the big tech OTTs: 
Changing the 
established policies and the wireless industry may require strong economic 
reasons 
and 
backing. We think that the big tech OTTs (Over The 
Top 
Companies) will in 
the 
medium term 
have the strongest interest to 
see DSA 
thriving. However, the OTTs have so far shown restraint from openly suggesting 
sweeping 
changes in the wireless 
market. 
While we think that DSA will play a 
role in future-shaping the relationship between the OTTs and 
the wireless 
industry, there 
is 
a range 
of possible 
outcomes. 
We would not rule 
out the 
scope for some 
negotiated outcome between the wireless 
industry and the 
OTTs in an attempt to avert the most disruptive 
scenarios. 
Impact on Sectors 
and Companies 


DSA may shift opportunities from wireless When 
considering 
the 
potential impact of DSAon prospects for 
different sectors 
and 
operators toward tech companies unless the companies, 
we should reiterate that the 
technology is in a relatively early 
stage, 
former become DIGITECCS hence it may be hard to 
predict its 
impact on 
the 
financials of major companies. 

Different scenarios are still possible 
depending on the 
success of the 
technology 
and regulatory developments 
but also 
strategic priorities of the key players, 
especially on the 
big 
tech side. Conceptually, we see the following potential 
impacts: 


• 
Global tech: 
Big tech, 
but also smaller innovative tech companies, may benefit 
from (a) opportunities to supply technologies and skills to manage DSA 
platforms; 
(b) opportunities to 
play a role in creatingAirbnb-or Uber-style shared 
wireless 
economies; 
(c) more 
bandwidth 
made available by 
DSA to users 
globally, which would expand 
the 
usage of OTT products; (d) easier opportunities 
to directly enter parts of the wireless 
market when 
needed (e.g., 
for specific IoT 
opportunities); (e) fragmentation of the wireless 
industry and weakening 
gatekeeper power of wireless 
operators 
even if net neutrality is not fully enforced; 
and (f) possible 
opportunities 
to use the disruptive threat of DSA 
to negotiate 
future relationships 
between OTTs and the wireless industry. 
• 
Telco equipment vendors: 
Equipment vendors could benefit from 
the 
need for 
more technologically-advanced equipment, 
although they also 
have 
exposure to 
disruptive risks in 
a 
hopefully unlikely scenario 
of DSA’s disruption outweighing 
its benefits. 
• 
Industrial & service companies: 
Innovative industrial/service companies may 
find 
it easier to 
build and operate their private networks. 
• 
Wireless 
MNOs (Mobile Network Operators): 
Wireless 
MNOs may see their 
business 
challenged 
by harder access to 
exclusive 
spectrum 
and 
more 
disruptive 
competition, both 
on the regional level and from outside 
of the industry. The 
degree of these 
challenges will depend 
on various 
factors, including 
the 
spectrum allocations, business models, regulations, disruptor activity, and 
availability of shared fiber infrastructure. 
We 
suggest the MNOs 
use their 
(possibly temporary) network 
and 
spectrum advantages to build 
more tech-savvy 
and 
service-focused business 
(we 
call this DIGITECCS).

However, MNOs could also take an advantage 
of DSA, which should give them 
the 
opportunity to access 
more spectrum and 
secure priority rights to such 
spectrum selectively in regions where they need it. 
Similar to 
legacy fixed-line 
incumbents such 
as 
AT&T and Deutsche 
Telekom, which 
invested into wireless in 
very early stages 
partially to hedge themselves against future disruptive trends, 
we can envisage wireless operators 
today potentially investing into new 
technologies and businesses, including those 
linked to DSA, for the 
same 
reasons. 


• 
Wireless 
MVNOs (Mobile 
Virtual Network Operators): 
The classical MVNOs 
and the disruptive role they play may become 
less 
needed and appealing 
under 
DSA. That said, 
MVNOs, assuming they have sufficient strategic and capital 
backing, could also aim at becoming DIGITECCS.
