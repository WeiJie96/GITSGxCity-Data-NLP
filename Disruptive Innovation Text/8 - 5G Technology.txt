7. 5G Technology 
Enabling Commercial Connectivity at Scale 


Wireless technologies have 
made dramatic improvements since the first cellular 
phone call was made in 
1973 
on a 2.5 pound, 10-inch long 
handset. Further 
progress 
has been made 
through the introduction of texting and digital voice (2G), 
simple 
data (3G), and broadband data (4G LTE). The chipsets needed to access 
mobile networks 
have also 
shrunk 
and 
dropped in price, and 
wireless 
connectivity 
has 
been added to myriad devices, 
from 
mobile 
credit card readers to remote 
monitoring systems. 
The so-called 
Internet of Things (IoT) and machine to machine 
(M2M) connectivity has allowed wireless carriers to 
dream beyond smartphones 
and imagine a larger addressable 
market. 


The initial 
standardization efforts of 5G technology were completed in June 2018, 
and preparations have begun to upgrade 
networks 
globally. While some 
carriers 
have been discussing the potential for 5G technology for three to five 
years, there 
remains 
a skepticism on its use cases among 
investors. We 
agree that this is likely 
a small improvement for consumer smartphones, but see a 
huge potential for 
commercial and industrial users that have 
not significantly benefitted from wireless 
technologies to date.

5G improves on four central attributes 
including lower latency, improved device 
density, improved speed and capacity, and 
dynamic spectrum access 

The 5G standards, as proposed by the International 
Telecommunications Union and 
developed by 3GPP, improve 
on 
four 
central attributes 
of the wireless 
connection 
that we believe as crucial to commercial connectivity: 


• 
Lower Latency. 
Latency is 
the 
delay between a request for information being 
made and the 
time the transmission begins; that delay will drop below 10 
milliseconds with 5G versus 50 milliseconds or more with 4G LTE. While this 
may 
not sound like 
much, it could 
mean the 
difference between 
an immersive virtual 
reality experience 
and 
a disorienting 
delay between 
moving 
your head and the 
changing view on the 
display. Lower latency will be 
key for emerging applications 
including autonomous 
driving, virtual and augmented reality, and 
mobile 
gaming.

• 
Device Density. With 
the 
5G standard, it is hoped that 
the network could 
connect as 
many as 1 million 
devices per square 
kilometer (0.38 
square 
miles). 
This is 
a 10x improvement over 4G and 
is 
key to 
the 
potential for vast sensor 
networks that report back on conditions ranging from air quality and humidity to 
whether a parking spot is 
available 
or if a 
streetlight is out. 
The Internet of 
Things 
depends 
on networks being able to 
handle 
a vast number of intelligent devices 
and reporting back to 
the 
network. 
• 
Speed and Capacity. As with any generational improvement, 5G will allow for 
faster average and peak 
speeds than previous standards. This 
bump in speeds, 
however, is being created by using more spectrum than was 
previously capable 
before 
rather than a 
significant leap in 
spectral efficiency. We equate wireless 
network technology to a highway: Spectral efficiency, or bits 
per hertz, is 
like the 
speed limit, 
while 
megahertz of spectrum is the number of lanes. 
The speed 
limit 
is expected to rise just 15%–20%, 
while the number of lanes is increasing 
by 5– 
10x as we move from 
4G to 
5G. 
• 
Dynamic Spectrum 
Access: 
A fourth important innovation 
with 5G is ‘network 
slicing,’ or the 
dynamic 
allocation of network capabilities based on 
the 
application. This would allow, for example, guaranteed low latency and reliability 
for first responders in an 
emergency while 
prioritizing speed 
for smartphone 
users. It 
allows network owners to 
customize the offer, and 
their network 
capabilities, to price 
the 
solutions needed by the end user rather than selling 
a 
one-size-fits-all product. 
(See 
earlier chapter on Dynamic Spectrum 
Access.)

The initial 5G 
standard from 3GPP, called Release 15, was completed in 
June 2018 
and 
can 
be put into existing networks through 
a software upgrade on 5G-capable 
equipment. 
This equipment has been available for more than a year, and U.S. 
operators will 
be first in 
select markets with a fixed 
wireless broadband and data-
only mobility focus. Moving into 2019, we expect launches 
in Japan and South 
Korea as well as the first consumer smartphones. Europe, China, and other major 
markets will 
launch from 2020 
as spectrum becomes 
available. Embedded modules 
for sensors, automobiles, and 
other IoT/M2M applications will also become 
available as 
manufacturing scales and chipset costs 
fall.

Expect Carriers to Explore New Business 
Cases Not 
Possible 
with Previous Technologies 


Better wireless 
broadband has allowed for more-intensive Internet use, including 
streaming video, but the cost of capacity and 
chipsets 
has limited 
usage to a largely 
consumer-focused end 
market. Some have looked to 
Wi-Fi, with cheaper chips and 
‘free’ 
unlicensed spectrum, but the inability to guarantee network quality and 
security limits the potential. Network slicing allows for lower costs than current 
mobile networks, better security than 
Wi-Fi, and 
customization that tailors the 
offer 
to the 
application. 


The global wireless industry generates 
$1 trillion 
of revenue 
annually, 
with one 
connection 
per person globally as of 2017. While this revenue stream 
can be 
grown 
through 
incremental 
connections and greater data usage, pricing pressures 
from 
competition have limited growth in recent years. As carriers explore new business 
cases, new large 
addressable 
markets 
are becoming available. 


The Internet of Things Expected to 
Be a Multi-Trillion 
Dollar Market 


A 2015 McKinsey study estimated the global IoT market will be worth $4–$11 trillion 
annually by 2025, with spending on 
IoT technology to be 
$300–$800 billion. The 
majority of technology spending will be for 
upstream 
software services, with 
just 
$15–$40 billion for connectivity. While traditional telecom companies have been 
unsuccessful historically in 
adding 
services 
to their connectivity offerings 
(the 
‘dumb 
pipe’ 
problem), many companies are pursuing acquisitions 
and partnerships to 
acquire the necessary skillset. 
Carrier consortia to 
provide services 
globally and 
present a 
single point of contact for enterprises have also formed, such as the IoT 
WorldAlliance 
and the BridgeAlliance. Potential IoT business cases include:

Using 5G wireless technology could create 
better private networks 

• 
Connected andAutonomous Vehicles: 
Modern automobiles have dozens 
of 
sensors that can be used to predict maintenance 
needs, predict track location, or 
effect autonomous 
driving. Embedding data 
connectivity into 
the car can 
make 
use 
of that data in ways that are not currently 
possible, 
including real-time 
traffic 
avoidance, better fleet management, and new ride-sharing business models. 
The 
low latency and large bandwidth available in 
5G 
are 
required, as 
milliseconds 
can 
matter in preventing 
collisions 
and the amount of data being 
created 
can 
be 
massive. 
• 
Smart Manufacturing: 
Smart manufacturing can leverage big data analytics to 
optimize production and manage the inventory of raw inputs 
into the process, 
and it has been 
called 
the fourth industrial revolution. Manufacturers can use 
wireless 
connectivity to 
monitor environmental factors, automate changes, track 
inventory, and adjust accordingly. Connecting the entire 
supply chain 
could allow 
for end-to-end tracking and monitoring 
from raw material to the finished 
good. 
Groups globally have formed to study the 
potential, including the U.S.-based 
Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition. 
• 
Digital Health: 
Connected fitness 
monitors 
may have been 
a fad, but Internet-
connected 
medical monitoring 
devices can improve health 
outcomes. 
With 
enhanced monitoring of patients with chronic illnesses 
such 
as diabetes and 
heart disease, health care providers 
can 
monitor whether treatment regimens are 
being adhered to and detect potential 
emergency conditions 
earlier. Other 
connected 
devices, such as heart rate monitors 
or sleep trackers, could 
track and 
incentivize better wellness habits among the population in general. 
• 
Smart Cities: 
Governments 
around the world are looking 
to IoT solutions to 
improve 
services, conserve natural resources, and 
generally 
improve 
the 
quality 
of life of the residents. 
These 
can range from real-time coordination of traffic 
signals to 
ease congestion and tracking 
parking 
meter usage to 
monitoring water 
and air quality and 
issuing timely emergency alerts. Sensors on critical 
infrastructure 
like bridges, roads, and utility networks 
could 
allow for predictive 
maintenance and avert poor maintenance 
conditions. Early examples of ‘smart 
city’ applications include 
the 
monitoring 
of full 
street wastebaskets and 
mass-
transit arrival information. 
Creating small private networks, either in a single building 
or distributed across 
multiple locations, has 
long been the purview of wired access solutions augmented 
with limited wireless 
or Wi-Fi networks. With 5G, that could 
be reversed given the 
lower cost of installing, maintaining, and updating a wireless 
network. Imagine a 
hospital where every machine 
and device 
are 
connected at all times 
and 
are 
freely 
movable room to room and floor to floor. Office 
environments can 
become more 
mobile and 
adaptable with employees taking devices 
anywhere in the 
building, or 
even outside the building, while maintaining wireless 
data 
connectivity. 


Barriers to 
Entry Include Spectrum Availability & Upfront 
Investment 


Anyone looking to deploy wireless 
networks 
needs 
access to 
spectrum, whether 
through exclusive licenses or unlicensed shared 
access. 
The ability of 
companies to 
deploy new 5G networks depends 
on country regulators 
making that new spectrum 
available, and will 
be the biggest hurdle 
to deployment. 
We’ve seen early access to 
new licensed spectrum 
bands 
through auction in the U.S., the 
U.K., and South 
Korea and allocation 
processes in China and Japan.

Once spectrum becomes 
available, the 
cost of deploying the 
network will be 
weighed against its revenue-generating 
potential, process efficiency gains, or 
whatever the business case requires. This could be 
a costly endeavor in 
certain 
cases, and 
it may limit interest in investing the necessary capital. 


There Are Many 
Potential 
Winners 


Wireless carriers are the 
obvious potential winners 
as they are committed to 
keeping 
up with technology and will look to better monetize the increasing data 
traffic on their networks. With 
5G technology, 
wireless companies will attempt to 
widen the lens of their business by addressing devices and use cases that either 
haven’t been successfully addressed or were not possible previously. Other 
potential winners 
include: 


– 
Technology companies 
could 
create new services based on 
the improved 
network attributes. Mobile console-quality gaming and virtual reality are just 
two examples of services that are made 
possible 
by 
5G. 
– 
IT services companies 
could 
benefit from using more wireless networking 
solutions to improve outcomes for their clients. Shifting from 
wired to wireless 
could accelerate deployment schedules and increase solution flexibility. 
– 
Manufacturing companies 
could see an 
improvement in supply chain efficiency 
by better monitoring 
materials 
and 
processes 
globally. 
We Expect 5G 
Wireless Could Displace Existing 
Technologies 


Telecom companies 
that focus on wired solutions could see 
new competition from 
5G wireless 
networks. Possible areas of competition 
include 
a broadband 
replacement service for 
consumers 
as well 
as 
more-flexible 
voice and data 
solutions for small businesses 
and branch offices of large enterprises. Other 
companies 
that could 
face disruption from new 
5G networks include: 


– 
Fixed broadband 
companies, including telecom 
companies but also 
cable 
operators, 
and 
alternative telecom 
providers 
could be displaced 
by wireless 
broadband 
solutions that can 
provide 
similar technical attributes with the 
benefit of mobility. 
– 
Network equipment companies that produce technology that could be 
displaced, such as 
Wi-Fi and 
Ethernet, would be at risk if they do 
not 
successfully pivot to 5G.
